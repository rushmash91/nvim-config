# 🌌 NeoVim Space Station 🌌

Welcome aboard the **NeoVim Space Station**, the home of my stellar Neovim configuration written entirely in Lua! 🚀 This repository is where I tinker with the engines of my text editor to make coding not just productive, but also a visual journey through the cosmos.

## 📦 Installation

Before docking with the station, ensure you have Neovim (0.5 or later) installed. Then, clone this repo into your Neovim configuration directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/neovim-space-station.git ~/.config/nvim
```

## ⭐ Features

Here's what makes the NeoVim Space Station special:

- **Telescope 🌠**: Peer through the lens of `telescope.nvim` to explore the files, strings, and commands like never before.
- **Treesitter 🌳**: Enjoy syntax highlighting that's not just pretty, but contextually aware, thanks to `nvim-treesitter`.
- **Rose Pine Theme 🌹**: Drift through the soft, rosy hues of the Rose Pine theme set to the 'moon' variant for a serene coding experience.
- **Harpoon 🧲**: Mark your most frequently visited files and switch between them swiftly with `harpoon`.
- **Undotree 🔄**: Navigate through the history of your changes with an intuitive visual tree.
- **Fugitive and Comment 🔏**: Command Git kingdoms with `vim-fugitive` and toggle comments in your codebase like flipping a light switch with `Comment.nvim`.
- **LSP and Autocompletion 🧠**: Intelligent code completion and linting configured out-of-the-box to elevate your code quality to the stars above.

## 🚀 Getting Started

After you've installed the configuration, launch Neovim and run `:PackerInstall` to install all the plugins. This is your launch sequence to prepare all systems for lift-off!
